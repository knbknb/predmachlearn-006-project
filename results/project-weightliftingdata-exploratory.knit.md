###  Programming Project: Qualitative Activity Recognition of Weight Lifting Exercises. 

### Synopsis 

> Predicting the quality of physical exercising. Analysis from sensor data acquired during exercising with dumbbells. This is Human Activity Recognition.  
Please read the file [Background](background.html) to get familiar with the assignment and the subject matter. You can also read an [academic paper](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/public/papers/2013.Velloso.QAR-WLE.pdf) on the open dataset, its [creators](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/work.jsf?p1=11201) and its use in medicine.

> The researchers were a team of at least of five people. Certainly they had the time to analyse the dataset very thoroughly. In contrast, I am a single individual taking off a couple of evenings to take a peek into the dataset. So this analysis is briefer. I will not take time-slices, as the authors did. It will focus on the dataset of a whole, and "only" on 50 of the 160 attributes provided.
